chromatic aberration1: the search for sasquatch

For many years humankind has yearned to seek the answers to the burning questions: are mysteries real? are legends merely the wisps of fantasies or do they, like the thread of ariadne, lead us out of the labrynth of "conventional science" and into the realm of veridinal phemonological discoveries?  What are we to make of these stories we have told ourselves over the millenia of memetic cultural evolution, these stories of the Wendingo, the Yeti, the Skinwalker.  What sense can we make of the archeological findings of non human hominids all over the world?  Who really built the pyramids?  How did the reptile people escape the cataclysms of Atlantis?  Why do frogs rain from the sky and why do voices cry out from deep holes in the earth?  Did a sasquatch drop a nuclear bomb on Tunguska in 1908?  Did a yeti write the Voynich Manuscript? Did the noble bigfoot assassinate John F. Kennedy as a part of some complex and ancient bigfoot "killing of the king" fertility ritual?  We may never know the answers to these questions.  We may never know the answers to any questions at all!  Perhaps what we need is to unask the questions and then perhaps we can receive some nonanswers!

I have analyzed the data available and have come to 1 solid conclusion:  The lack of proof of non human homind existence is primarily due to the lack of high quality real time multiband colorizer/solarizer video processing units.  Imagine if you will, if Patterson and Gimlin had access to a 4 band colorizer and brightness attenuator while they were filming? What would science say to an enhanced footage wherein the brightness scale of the input video was split into 4 bands (0-.25, .25-.5, .5-.75, .75-1) where each band had separate hardware controls for assigning hue, saturation, and reassigning offsets to brightness?  But thats not all!  They could also have used the EIGHT (8) lfos (2 for each band 1 for hue and one for brightness) to oscillate hue and brightness in order to draw attention to salient points of interest in the footage!  I have a hunch I know what science would say.  Science:"thats pretty fucking dank yo".

controls

all controls for this are Unipolar!

1-4 Saturation controls for bands 1-4 respectively

5-8 Lfo rate for hue/brightness for bands 1-4 respectively

9-12 (default) Hue select for bands 1-4, when S button is pressed next to each slider then the mode switches to Brightness offset for each bands

13-16 (defalult) amplitude for Hue Lfo, when S button is pressed next to each slider then the mode switches to amplitude for Brightness offset for each band, this also switches 5-8 to control brightness lfo rates.

a,b,c - switches on and off different curves for assigning hue from brightness
